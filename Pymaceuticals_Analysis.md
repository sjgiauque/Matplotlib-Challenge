**Pymaceuticals Analysis**

  1.Through an evaluation of the outcomes of each analysis, starting with a view of mouse survival rates during treatment, it becomes apparent that the drug Capomulin had the most beneficial, or at least, the lease detrimental effect.  This is perhaps most evident in the last two graphs, “Survival During Treatment” and “Tumor Change over 45 Day Treatment,” where survival rates of mice who were administered this drug had the highest and least digressive survival rates and even showed erosion in tumor growth over the 45 day treatment period.  

  2.We arrive at a similar conclusion when looking at the graph “Tumor Response to Treatment” where tumor volume in mice who were administered the drug Capomulin appears to decline over time, whereas tumor growth increases in mice who were administered other drugs as well as the placebo control.  

  3.Finally, while the drug Capomulin does show the most favorable outcome, in fact, none of the tested drugs show indication of fully curbing metastic spread through the course of treatment duration, as exhibited in the graph “Metastic Spread During Treatment.”
